//! Host side of the DualEye PC monitor.

//! [`Collector`] reads CPU, GPU, memory and fan sensors straight from the OS (no
//! CoolerControl or other daemon), [`Snapshot`] is the JSON line the firmware
//! parses, and [`Bridge`] ties them to the board's USB serial port on a
//! background thread, and [`Esptool`] identifies and flashes the board.
//! [`ClaudeUsage`] adds Claude Code's usage for the Claude faces. The CLI
//! and a Tauri app are both thin shells over this.
