PC monitoring on **ESP32-S3 DualEye** (two 240×240 round displays): CPU/GPU temperatures, load, fans, RAM and VRAM, plus Claude Code usage with its mascot, on Apple Watch–style faces you pick per screen.

A standalone Rust program on the host reads the sensors straight from the OS (no CoolerControl or other daemon) and sends them to the board over USB Serial/JTAG as one JSON line per second.

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| Firmware (`main/`) | LVGL UI + metrics ingest |
| `host/dualeye-core` | Library: sensors → snapshot → USB serial. Meant to be embedded in a [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) app |
| `host/dualeye-cli` | `dualeye` command-line bridge built on the library |
| `host/dualeye-app` | Desktop app ([Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app/) + Svelte): live mirror of both screens, history, sensors, board console, firmware flashing |

End users only need the desktop app installer, from the [latest release](https://github.com/EttoreCaputo/esp32s3-dualeye-pcmonitor/releases/latest) (Windows, macOS, Linux; the firmware is inside); everything below the app section is for working on the source (see [Building from source](#building-from-source)).

**Stack:** ESP-IDF ≥ 5.4 · [lvgl/lvgl](https://components.espressif.com/components/lvgl/lvgl) `9.3.0` · [espressif/esp_lcd_gc9a01](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_lcd_gc9a01) `^2.0.4` · Rust (sysinfo, nvml-wrapper, serialport)

## Host bridge

Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), then close `idf.py monitor` (it holds the same port) and run:

```bash
cd host
cargo run --release              # auto-detects the board (USB 303a:xxxx) and streams
cargo run --release -- --once    # print one snapshot, no serial
cargo run --release -- --sensors # every raw sensor the backends can see
cargo run --release -- --cpu-face rings --gpu-face plus
cargo run --release -- --help
```

The binary ends up in `host/target/release/dualeye` (`dualeye.exe` on Windows) and has no runtime dependencies.

### What each OS provides

| Data | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| CPU load, clock | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| CPU temp (avg of all CPU sensors) | hwmon: coretemp, k10temp, zenpower | ACPI thermal zone (run as admin; many boards report nothing) | SMC / IOHID |
| CPU power | RAPL (see below) | — | — |
| NVIDIA GPU (temp, load, clock, power, fan RPM) | NVML | NVML | — |
| AMD GPU | hwmon `amdgpu` | — | — |
| Mac GPU (temp, load, memory) | — | — | SMC (`Tg*` keys on Apple Silicon, `TG*` on Intel), IOAccelerator |
| Fans | hwmon (`cpu` = fastest board fan, `gpu` = fastest GPU fan) | — | — |
| RAM | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| VRAM | NVML, `amdgpu` (`mem_info_vram_*`) | NVML | IOAccelerator (Apple Silicon: GPU share of the unified RAM) |

Missing values are just left out of the snapshot; the board shows what it gets.

**Linux, serial access:** `sudo usermod -aG dialout "$USER"`, then log out and back in.

**Linux, CPU power:** `energy_uj` is root-only since the RAPL side-channel fix (CVE-2020-8694). To show package power anyway, make it world-readable at boot:

```bash
echo 'z /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj 0444 - - -' | sudo tee /etc/tmpfiles.d/dualeye-rapl.conf
```

```bash
sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create /etc/tmpfiles.d/dualeye-rapl.conf
```

## Watch faces

Each screen shows one of six faces, chosen independently (left = CPU, right = GPU):

| Face | Shows |
|------|-------|
| `classic` | Temperature, clock, power, fan RPM; load on the ring (the default) |
| `rings` | Three rings, outside in: load, temperature (cyan, orange from 80 °C, red from 90 °C), memory; temperature and both percentages in the middle |
| `plus` | Classic, plus a bar under the load and fan row for RAM (left) or VRAM (right) with GiB used/total; orange from 90 % |
| `bar` | Classic with a smaller RAM/VRAM bar under the load and fan row, no numbers |
| `claude` | Claude Code: 5-hour limit used on the outer ring and in the middle, weekly limit on the inner ring (orange from 80 %, red from 95 %), time to the 5-hour reset, and a small Clawd. Without the status line: tokens in the 5-hour window, the window's progress on the ring, and today's tokens |
| `clawd` | Claude Code's mascot, large and animated: walks while Claude works, blinks when idle, sleeps after 30 min; model name, state and tokens in the window |

Pick them in the app (Settings → **Display**, saved across restarts) or with `--cpu-face` / `--gpu-face` on the CLI. The host sends the choice in every line, so the board switches on the next snapshot and needs no storage of its own; a line without `face` shows `classic`.

### Claude Code faces

The host reads Claude Code's usage from two local sources, with nothing to set up for the first:

- **Transcripts** (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects`): tokens per reply (input, output and cache writes; cache reads are left out, they would swamp the figure), counted in Claude Code's 5-hour windows and since midnight. A transcript written in the last 20 s means Claude is working. The format is internal to Claude Code, so it is read leniently.
- **Status line**, for the plan's 5-hour and weekly limits (Pro and Max): Settings → **Display** → **Connect status line** sets `statusLine` in `~/.claude/settings.json` to `dualeye-app --claude-statusline` (a copy of the file is kept as `settings.json.dualeye-backup`). Claude Code then pipes its status JSON to the app, which keeps the latest copy and prints your previous status line (or a short default: model, 5h %, 7d %). **Disconnect** puts the previous one back. The CLI takes the same `--claude-statusline` flag.

## Desktop app

`host/dualeye-app` runs the same bridge in the background and shows, in real time, what the two round screens are displaying. The mirror follows `main/ui_watch.c` (ring geometry, fonts, colours, warm/hot/stale/waiting states), so keep them in sync when the firmware UI changes. It also plots 3 minutes of history and lists raw sensors, serial ports and the board's log. Closing the window hides it in the tray and streaming continues.

How to run and package it is in [Building from source](#building-from-source).

### Identify and flash the board

Settings → **Device** finds the ESP32-S3 on USB, reads its chip, MAC and flash size, and flashes the firmware. The image is `build/merged-binary.bin` (bootloader + partition table + app, written at `0x0`), embedded in the app at build time, so replace that file and rebuild the app to ship a new firmware (the build warns when a file in `main/` is newer than the image, i.e. `idf.py build merge-bin` wasn't rerun). It works on a blank board too, since esptool talks to the ROM bootloader; streaming pauses meanwhile and the board reboots afterwards.

Flashing uses [esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32s3/index.html) and the user installs nothing: the first time Identify or Flash is used, the app

1. takes the system Python if it is 3.10+ with `venv` (Linux, Windows), otherwise downloads a portable CPython from [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone), pinned and SHA-256 checked (never the system one on macOS, whose stub opens the Xcode installer);
2. creates a virtualenv and `pip install`s esptool 5.x into it.

That is about 45 MB downloaded once (internet needed only then) and ~170 MB on disk, in the app's local data folder under `esptool/` (`~/.local/share/com.dualeye.monitor/esptool` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.dualeye.monitor\esptool` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/com.dualeye.monitor/esptool` on macOS). The output of the last setup is in `setup.log` there, and the Device tab shows it too when something fails. Delete that folder to force a fresh setup. The logic is in `dualeye-core` behind the `provision` feature, which only the app enables. The equivalent command line is:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 write-flash 0x0 build/merged-binary.bin
```

### Firmware updates

The firmware knows its version (`version.txt`, which ESP-IDF builds into the image's app descriptor) and prints it as `{"dualeye":"0.2.0","idf":"v6.1"}` when it boots and whenever it reads a `?version` line. The bridge asks every 5 s after connecting until the board answers; firmware from before 0.2.0 ignores the question but keeps logging the snapshots it gets, so after two unanswered questions it counts as "before 0.2.0". A ROM looping on `invalid header` means a blank flash.

The app reads the version of the image it carries from that same app descriptor. When the board runs an older one, a banner offers the update and lists what changes, taken from the sections of [`FIRMWARE_CHANGELOG.md`](FIRMWARE_CHANGELOG.md) newer than the board's version; **Update…** opens the Device tab to flash it.

To release a new firmware: bump `version.txt`, add its `## <version>` section to `FIRMWARE_CHANGELOG.md` (the release pipeline fails without it), and rebuild the image.

The app talks to the bridge through `dualeye_core::Bridge`; its events (`waiting`, `connected`, `snapshot`, `board_log`, `firmware`, `disconnected`) are forwarded to the webview as `bridge`.

```

### Prerequisites

| Part | Needs |
|------|-------|
| Firmware | [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/get-started/) ≥ 5.4, or the dev container in `.devcontainer/` |
| CLI | [Rust](https://rustup.rs) ≥ 1.85 (edition 2024) |
| Desktop app | Rust, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 20.19, plus the platform packages below |

Desktop app, per platform (once):

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libsoup-3.0-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev build-essential
  ```

  Other distros: see [Tauri's prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). Add yourself to `dialout` for serial access (see above).
- **Windows:** [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with "Desktop development with C++" and the Rust MSVC toolchain. WebView2 ships with Windows 10/11.
- **macOS:** `xcode-select --install`.

### Firmware

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3   # first time only
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
```

To update the image the desktop app ships, merge bootloader, partition table and app into one file and commit it:

```bash
idf.py merge-bin            # writes build/merged-binary.bin
```

`.gitignore` ignores `build/` except that file. The app embeds it at compile time (`include_bytes!` in `host/dualeye-app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), so rebuild the app afterwards.

### CLI

```bash
cd host
cargo build --release       # host/target/release/dualeye
```

Plain `cargo` commands in `host/` only touch `dualeye-core` and `dualeye-cli` (the workspace's default members), so they work without the GUI packages.

### Watch faces

Each screen shows one of six faces, chosen independently (left = CPU, right = GPU):

| Face | Shows |
|------|-------|
| `classic` | Temperature, clock, power, fan RPM; load on the ring (the default) |
| `rings` | Three rings, outside in: load, temperature (cyan, orange from 80 °C, red from 90 °C), memory; temperature and both percentages in the middle |
| `plus` | Classic, plus a bar under the load and fan row for RAM (left) or VRAM (right) with GiB used/total; orange from 90 % |
| `bar` | Classic with a smaller RAM/VRAM bar under the load and fan row, no numbers |
| `claude` | Claude Code: 5-hour limit used on the outer ring and in the middle, weekly limit on the inner ring (orange from 80 %, red from 95 %), time to the 5-hour reset, and a small Clawd. Without the status line: tokens in the 5-hour window, the window's progress on the ring, and today's tokens |
| `clawd` | Claude Code's mascot, large and animated: walks while Claude works, blinks when idle, sleeps after 30 min; model name, state and tokens in the window |

Pick them in the app (Settings → **Display**, saved across restarts) or with `--cpu-face` / `--gpu-face` on the CLI. The host sends the choice in every line, so the board switches on the next snapshot and needs no storage of its own; a line without `face` shows `classic`.

## Desktop app

```bash
cd host/dualeye-app
npm install
npm run dev                 # UI only, in a browser, with synthetic data: no board or Rust needed
npm run tauri dev           # the real app, hot reload on UI changes
npm run tauri build         # release build + installers
```

`npm run tauri build` packages for the OS it runs on (Tauri does not cross-compile), into `host/target/release/bundle/`:

| Built on | Output |
|----------|--------|
| Linux | `deb/*.deb`, `rpm/*.rpm`, `appimage/*.AppImage` |
| Windows | `msi/*.msi`, `nsis/*-setup.exe` |
| macOS | `macos/*.app`, `dmg/*.dmg` (`-- --target universal-apple-darwin` for Intel + Apple Silicon, after `rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin`) |

To ship all three from one place, run the build on a CI matrix (e.g. GitHub Actions with [tauri-action](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action)). Unsigned builds work but Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper warn about them; signing needs a code-signing certificate / Apple Developer ID.

Where things live in the app:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Screen mirror (keep in sync with `main/ui_watch.c`) | `src/lib/Board.svelte`, `Eye.svelte`, `firmware.ts` |
| Live state, bridge/flash events, synthetic preview feed | `src/lib/monitor.svelte.ts` |
| Settings drawer (Connection, Display, Device, Sensors, Console) | `src/lib/Drawer.svelte` |
| Tauri commands, tray, bridge lifecycle | `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` |
| Claude Code usage and the status line helper | `host/dualeye-core/src/claude.rs`, `claude/statusline.rs` |
| esptool runner and first-use setup | `host/dualeye-core/src/flasher.rs`, `flasher/setup.rs` |

### Releases

Every push to `main` runs [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml): it builds the firmware with ESP-IDF v6.1 (`idf.py build merge-bin`), checks that the image carries `version.txt` and that the changelog has a section for it, then builds the app on Linux (AppImage, deb, rpm), Windows (msi, NSIS) and macOS (dmg, Apple Silicon and Intel) with that fresh image embedded, and uploads everything, plus the bare firmware image, to the GitHub release `v<version>` from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Bump that version to cut a new release; until then each merge replaces the assets of the current one. The builds aren't code-signed, so macOS and Windows warn on first launch.

### Checks

```bash
cd host && cargo test -p dualeye-core --features provision
```

```bash
cd host && cargo test -p dualeye-app      # the bundled image carries version.txt
```

```bash
cd host/dualeye-app && npm run check
```

## Wire format

```json
{"v":1,"ts":1790419114,"cpu":{"temp_c":40.2,"load_pct":2.8,"clock_mhz":1210,"power_w":14.6,"mem":{"used_mb":12568,"total_mb":62277}},"gpu":{"temp_c":35.0,"load_pct":0.0,"clock_mhz":210,"power_w":22.1,"mem":{"used_mb":14,"total_mb":24576}},"fans":[{"id":"cpu","rpm":3824},{"id":"gpu","rpm":0}],"face":{"cpu":"rings","gpu":"plus"}}
```

Parsed by `main/metrics_parser.c`; lines without any temperature are ignored, and the UI goes stale after 3 s without data. `mem` is in MiB: system RAM under `cpu`, VRAM under `gpu`. `face` is added by the bridge, not the sensor collector; unknown face names fall back to `classic`. So is `claude`, when Claude Code has run on this machine:

```json
"claude":{"tok":1234567,"today":4500000,"left_min":133,"s_pct":42.0,"w_pct":18.0,"state":"work","model":"OPUS 5.5"}
```

`tok` and `today` are tokens in the 5-hour window and since local midnight, `left_min` the minutes until the window resets, `s_pct` / `w_pct` the 5-hour and weekly limits used (only with the status line connected), `state` one of `work`, `idle`, `sleep`.
